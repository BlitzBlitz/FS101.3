    <h1>DOGE Is Putting Major Government Efficiency Projects at Risk</h1>
    <h2>
      In its apparent quest to cut government spending and improve efficiency,
      DOGE has fired entire tech teams devoted to those very things.

    <p>
      Since <a href="https://www.wired.com/">Elon Musk's</a> so-called
      Department of Government Efficiency took over important government
      technology teams within the General Services Administration (GSA) and what
      was formally known as the United States Digital Service (USDS), around 200
      technologists have either resigned or been fired, jeopardizing about a
      decade's worth of work dedicated to everything from public health to
      passport applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The culling of the GSA's 18F division, in particular, a specialized
      digital services agency tasked with improving user experience with
      government services and helping agencies build and buy a variety of
      technologies, has crippled programs that silently but effectively prepared
      Americans for weather disasters or streamlined annoying errands, like
      renewing a passport or filing taxes. Over the weekend, around 90
      technologists at 18F were fired via a surprise email that went out shortly
      before 1 am ET on Saturday.
