0. A Programming Language:
    What:   A Language used to give commands to the computer
    Why:    To automate most of the stuffs
    How:    We write commands in the .js file to order 
                the comptuer to do the heavy lifting

1. Varaibles
    What:   Are boxes in the memory that can store data/content/information
    Why:    To store data so we can use it for later
    How:    
            let age;      //reserve a box in the memory [declaring a variable]
            let name;

            age = 10;       //saving 10 to the variable "age"
            name = "Jack";


2. Data Types
    What:   Categories of data/content/information
    Why:    To Treat(save, delete, change) data better
    How:
            types:   number     10, -100, 0
                     string     "Jack", "name", "10"
                     boolean    True, False

3. Operators
    What:   Small functions that can do one small job
    Why:    To Do calculations (math, logic)
    How: 
            Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %

                5 / 2 = 2.5 | 2(1)
                5 % 2 = 1

                7 % 2 = 1
                8 % 2 = 0
            Conditional:    > < >= <= == !=

                5 > 2               True
                5 > 5               False
            "Anna" > "Ben"          False
               3   >  4

            "Anna" < "Annastasia"   True

            "Anna" < "Anna"         False

            10 != -10               True
